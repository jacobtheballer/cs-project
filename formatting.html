    <p><b>Writings </b>have to do with <sub>Native Americans</sub>and the <del>complicated</del> struggles <i>>they've had with The USA</i> and its government .The timeline of  Native American history  it struggles with the US government have a long history dating all the way back to 1600 and not reaching a close but a kind of standstill in the 1990s.I only were they kicked out of their environment / land but they were forced to be driven out into Uncharted Territory and to make that their   place to live and losing lots of their people in the process due to disease due to traveling in Non-suitable conditions. And even more it was very difficult as a US Government even still after doing  all of these harmful actions to the Native Americans still had many restrictions and laws that went against Native Americans making their struggle to even be part of the US a difficult time.

    <p>There's experiences as being <sub> Native American </sub>himself and seeing the struggles of his people have a very strong influence in what he's talking about and his writings and his concerned cause of tone. A he saw abuse at many different levels towards his people and his people doing it towards  their own.  with him voicing his concerns it shows that he cares for his people and also want to see change in a positive way.In a mellow but concerned voice as he realizes that the issues are major but wants to come across as civilized as possible so that everyone can understand what he's saying without immediately coming to assumptions about him.

    <p style="color:purple;">Passage kind of makes me feel of the way of understanding where everyone's been in the situation where they're trying to do something that they know they can do but others around them are telling them that it's not possible or are trying to stop them from doing it for their own reasons. which makes a person that is trying to achieve this goal or reach this new height annoyed or pissed off due to the facts of them limiting the ability to get to that goal. 

<p style="color:#CE9EF0;">Pretty cool thing when you think about it but there's also a lot of negative things but with all the positive and negative things it's had a major impact which is kind of funny when you think about it cuz it started off as a minor little thing like most things do LOL. A lot of people use social media to watch videos  post stuff that's going on in their life or just  talk about the boring news And political  drama.  funny and interesting thing is that social media is kind of like the wild west when you think of it because there's no limitation for what people can post and what people can't post or when there is limitations to limitations are very  unrestricted or minor restrictions which lead to many little kids and little children being vulnerable to get seeing things they shouldn't it's pretty scary when you think about it. Social media is impact us in a major way with advancement of tech  in other technological  nonsense has shaped the world to be very different in many factors and strange ways.
