    <h1>my webiste and the details of amricean history .</h1>
    <p><b>To summarize Reflections on the Bicentennial of the Constitution I will be talking about it and giving my personal opinion in view about the writing.  the main point of the writing is to reflect about the Constitution and to appreciate what it was at that time but  mainly realize that it's flawed and those flaws need to be changed to adapt to the modern period and to be more open for other people. the main point of the flaw is slavery and how it doesn't recognize black people as people and more as property which causes a great problem in the society in America and in general. And it also reflects about how even though that the constitution is held very high in regard that even a writing like that can be flawed due to its predate writing and How It Was Written a long time ago and how the world and Society has adapted and changed into new ways  and Progressive ways. And in my opinion I think he's right due to the fact of slavery being such a major issue and how unjust it is and how if no one is going to recognize the issue with the Constitution that the problem of slavery will never be fixed or will have to take a longer and more difficult route to be fixed. and I do agree that it's not like he is trashing the Constitution or talking bad about it but he's really more or less recognizing that with time some of the rules or laws in it don't hold up to the modern  time period. Overall I think what he's saying is justified and  what he is arguing for is a good cause as he is arguing for Change and specifically the abolishment of slavery or the recognition of black people as members of society and not property in the Constitution.

    <p>Any multiple texts about the  same historical moment due to how much of a Major Impact it had on the people that lived in the country and how it still affects us till this day. and it's also important to read more about it if you're doing a research paper or you're going to talk about it. You want to know as much information as possible because you want to be  informed about what you're giving your opinion on. especially if a lot of  people are looking at you for information or wanting to hear your opinion. Add more similarities than they did have differences as they both highlighted the injustices and issues that were going on in the country towards Native Americans. and they both highlighted how these actions were not committed that long ago and how they are still affecting Native Americans till this day.You like both of them get their point across but I do think they could go into more detail or give actual examples that they've seen or heard so that you can get a more of a emotional or visual idea of what happened and how it felt  for those Native Americans to go through all this. I'd say they both did what their main goal was which in my opinion is to get a good idea of the Native American struggles in America and what they need help with in to get the point across that these struggles are still prevalent till this day.
