    <p style="color:tomato;">The writing is about the constitution in its flaws that come to tuition in the current time period, specifically slavery and the unrecognition of black people as humans. With the Constitution being as a major piece of Law and history when there's flaws that are in it people are hesitant to point them out or even act on an obvious flaw that can harm people and cause issues such as the laws of freedom that black people do not have at the current time.. Founding fathers at the time also lived in a different time period or many of the ideas and  mindset were different then between the current time period. So, like most things, when time goes by countries the world progresses and things change and new ideas and  get put into  place And with that the laws  should change to adapt to the time.There's quotes in the Constitution that go against the rights of people because they are not mentioned in the Constitution a good quote that  gives a good picture for this is the quote that I will provide to you now. “
</p>
    <p>A
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that their Creator endows them with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness part of the concession”.The issue with this quote is that it doesn't mention women And they didn't really recognize black people as people so it's vague when it says men and even if they said females it would still be fake because it do they recognize them as people or property.  another quote  from the Constitution that has issues is Slavery, but also mentions that it can be used as a form of punishment. The states that were part of the Union as the country was split during that time period, and the Confederate States continued with slavery. There are many things I need to change with the Constitution, and they all have to do with not only race but was the way things have changed and adapted in society in general.
